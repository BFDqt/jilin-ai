## 00 Overview
In 2025, Jilin-AI participated in the China Collegiate Synthetic Biology Innovation Competition (CCiC). This competition provided a platform for students from universities across China to showcase their research and exchange ideas. During the competition, Jilin-AI engaged in various activities, including company visits, project presentations, poster discussions, and workshops. These interactions allowed the team to gain valuable insights, exchange experiences, and foster collaborations with universities and companies. The competition not only served as a stage for presenting research成果, but also as a bridge for academic exchange and collaboration. Looking ahead, Jilin-AI will continue to uphold a spirit of exploration and innovation, sharing the story of Jilin University’s synthetic biology journey on even larger stages.

Before the conference, Jilin-AI was invited to visit 北京深势科技公司. The discussion centered on “bohrium”, a research assistant tool. Through Q&A session and idea sharing, the team gained a clearer understanding of its function and proposed suggestions based on our own research needs. The face-to-face exchange led to mutual insights into both research support and tool innovation.

## 02 Project Presentation
On the second day, Jilin-AI presented their project BiomniGEM during the road show. Members introduced the background, design concepts, and expected outcomes in a structured and logical way.

## 03 Poster Discussion
At the poster exhibition, Jilin-AI’s booth attracted many visitors. Team members patiently explained project details, highlighting technical innovations and creative approaches, which earned positive feedback from attendees. Members also took the initiative to visit other universities and companies’ booths, discussing project design, experimental challenges, and modeling methods. These exchanges brought novel ideas and allowed the team to re-examine our own research from new perspectives.

## 04 Workshop
Workshops were another highlight of CCiC. Jilin-AI first joined the Modeling Workshop, engaging in in-depth discussions with teams from Peking University, Nanjing University, and others about model design and applications. The exchange of perspectives and experiences enriched our research thinking. Later, a self-organized workshop led by Nanjing University allowed a even more open discussion. Teams introduced their project progress and shared insights. Through direct interaction, Jilin-AI gained a better understanding of different research paths across disciplines and drew inspiration from peer researchers.

## 06 Conclusion & Outlook
Across three days of conference, Jilin-AI participated in company visits, project presentations, poster sessions and workshops, demonstrating the creativity and practice of Jilin University’s student researchers. By exchanging with top universities and industry guests, we gained insights and built valuable connections. CCiC is not just a mere stage for presenting research, but more of a bridge for academic exchange and collaboration. Looking ahead, Jilin-AI will continue to uphold a spirit of exploration and innovation, sharing the story of Jilin University’s synthetic biology journey on even larger stages.
