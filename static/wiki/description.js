## Background | Challenges for Synthetic Biologists

In today's data-intensive era, synthetic biologists are facing unprecedentedly complex problems. With the continuous development of high-throughput sequencing technologies and multi-omics analysis, we have obtained massive amounts of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. But at the same time, new problems have emerged:

* **Data flood but knowledge fragmentation**: Information such as DNA sequences, gene expression profiles, and protein structures is scattered across different databases and tools, making it difficult for researchers to integrate and analyze, often leading to "seeing the trees but not the forest."
* **Exponential growth of literature**: A large number of new papers are published every day, making it difficult for researchers to keep up with the latest developments, let alone form a systematic understanding.
* **Increasingly complex design tasks**: From gene circuit design to metabolic pathway optimization, it is necessary to comprehensively consider multiple levels such as genetic regulation, protein function, and cellular state.
* **Tools operating in isolation**: Existing tools often have single functions and do not support cross-platform integrated analysis; the operation threshold is high, and many require proficiency in command-line or scripting languages.

Although artificial intelligence has shown great potential in many fields, in synthetic biology, we still lack an AI assistant that can truly "understand what scientists are saying."

## Limitations of Existing Tools

Currently, both general large language models and specialized bioinformatics tools have their own bottlenecks:

### Problems with General Language Models

* **Cannot understand "biological language"**: Unable to recognize biology-specific data formats such as DNA, RNA, and proteins.
* **Answers are superficial**: Even if they can answer scientific questions, they often lack in-depth logic and professional understanding.
* **Lack of reasoning ability**: Difficult to make reasonable judgments or design new schemes based on complex experimental data and background information.

### Limitations of Bioinformatics Tools

* **Only do "single-choice questions"**: Each tool handles only specific tasks and is difficult to collaborate with each other.
* **Unfriendly operation**: Natural language interaction basically does not exist, requiring professional background to get started.
* **Information not shared**: Different data formats between tools often interrupt analysis workflows, limiting research efficiency.

## BIOMNIGEM: Born for Synthetic Biology

BIOMNIGEM is a large language model we have developed specifically for synthetic biology research. It can not only understand your questions but also perform reasoning, analysis, and design suggestions based on omics data.

Its three core capabilities:

### Understand Multi-omics Data

BIOMNIGEM natively supports three main biological data formats and directly understands experimental data:

* `<dna>`: Supports functional prediction and structural analysis of DNA sequences
* `<cell>`: Interprets transcriptomic data to grasp changes in cellular state
* `<protein>`: Understands protein sequences and insights into their functions and conformations

### Possess Biologists' Way of Thinking

By building a specialized synthetic biology reasoning dataset (over 10,000 CoT data), we train BIOMNIGEM to think like a scientist:

* Clarify causal relationships between variables
* Make reasonable inferences about the reasons for experimental failures
* Propose specific suggestions for design improvements
* Make scientific judgments by integrating information from multiple sources

Compared with traditional tools, BIOMNIGEM is no longer a black-box model but can "explain its own reasoning process," providing results while telling you "why."

### Multi-task Training, Covering the Entire Workflow

We adopt a three-stage training strategy to enable the model to gradually master complete capabilities from basic knowledge to advanced reasoning:

1. Pre-training on basic biological knowledge
2. Reinforcement learning in the field of synthetic biology
3. Dual optimization of reasoning ability and natural language instructions

At the same time, we have designed 10 different task types, including single-modal data understanding, multi-modal information fusion, complex experimental reasoning, etc., to ensure that the model performs stably and reliably in actual scientific research scenarios.

## Our Contributions

### For the Synthetic Biology Research Community

1. **Open dataset**: A large-scale reasoning dataset specifically designed for synthetic biology (10,000+ entries)
2. **Open-source model weights**: The trained BIOMNIGEM model can be directly deployed or further fine-tuned by researchers
3. **Application paradigm demonstration**: Show how AI can truly understand synthetic biology and biological data, and assist humans in synthetic biology research

## Looking to the Future

BIOMNIGEM is the first step we have taken. Our vision is:

**Empowering every synthetic biology researcher with an AI assistant that truly understands biology and can think.**

Liberated from complicated data processing, researchers can spend more time on creation and exploration. We believe that such tools can not only improve research efficiency but also accelerate the pace of innovation in the entire field of synthetic biology.
