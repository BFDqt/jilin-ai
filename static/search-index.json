Bronze Medal Criterion #1: Wiki Describe how and why you chose your iGEM project. Visit the Medals page for more information. The Story of a Fragmented Puzzle Imagine trying to understand a grand story by reading only scattered pages from different books. This is the reality for many biologists today. One dataset holds secrets about DNA, another about gene expression, and a third about protein structures. These are all part of the same biological narrative, but they exist in different languages, stored in separate libraries. The tools to analyze them are just as fragmented‚Äîspecialized, inflexible, and unable to speak to one another. This \"data silo\" problem creates a massive gap between the questions scientists want to ask and the answers they can get. How does a change in a gene affect a whole network of proteins? How can we design a protein for a specific function based on a cell's current state? Answering these questions requires a holistic view that current AI tools, trained on single data types, simply cannot provide. They can find patterns, but they can't reason. They can predict, but they can't explain. This friction, the \"wet lab-dry lab divide,\" is a major bottleneck slowing down breakthroughs in medicine, agriculture, and bio-engineering. Introducing BIOMNIGEM: The Unifier We envisioned a different future. A future where a single, intelligent system could read all the pages of biology at once, understand their connections, and discuss its findings with the researcher. This vision is BIOMNIGEM. BIOMNIGEM is not just another predictive model; it's a reasoning engine for biology. We built our framework around a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), teaching it to be fluent in the languages of DNA, RNA, and proteins simultaneously. It is the first biological AI of its kind to be trained with true cross-modal understanding, allowing it to learn the fundamental rules that govern how these systems interact. By talking to BIOMNIGEM, a researcher can move seamlessly from a DNA sequence to a 3D protein structure, predict how a cellular environment will react to a new drug, and even generate novel hypotheses. It's more than a tool‚Äîit's a collaborative partner, designed to amplify human intuition and accelerate the cycle of scientific discovery. BIOMNIGEM is our answer to the fragmented puzzle, piecing together the full story of life itself. Project Vision Bridge the gap between different biological data types through unified AI analysis Enable true cross-modal understanding of DNA, RNA, and protein interactions Provide an intelligent reasoning engine that can explain its predictions Accelerate the cycle of biological discovery through collaborative AI partnership Make advanced computational biology accessible to researchers without deep AI expertise Key Features Multimodal Analysis: Process genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data ...",

Computational Experiments In the context of BIOMNIGEM, our \"laboratory\" was the high-performance computing cluster, and our \"experiments\" were rigorous computational tests designed to validate our hypotheses. Our experimental plan focused on answering several key questions: Experiment 1: Specialized vs. General-Purpose Models Research Question Can a specialized biological LLM outperform larger, general-purpose models? Experimental Design We conducted head-to-head benchmark tests, comparing BIOMNIGEM against models like GPT-4o and LLaMA-3.1 on tasks such as cell type annotation. Results BIOMNIGEM achieved a 97% accuracy, significantly surpassing the performance of its larger competitors, confirming the value of domain-specific training. Model Parameters Cell Type Annotation Accuracy LLaMA-3.1-70B 70B 77% GPT-4o ~1.8T 89% BIOMNIGEM (SFT) 30B 93% BIOMNIGEM (RL) 30B 97% Experiment 2: Cross-Modal Training Benefits Research Question Does cross-modal training improve single-modality task performance? Experimental Design We trained two versions of our model: one on isolated data types and another on an integrated, multimodal dataset. We then compared their performance on a protein function prediction task. Results The multimodally trained model showed superior performance, suggesting it developed a more robust internal representation of biological principles. Experiment 3: Complex Reasoning Capabilities Research Question Can the model perform complex, multi-step reasoning? Experimental Design We designed \"Biological Chain-of-Thought\" (BioCoT) tasks. For example, we provided a DNA mutation and asked the model to predict the change in protein structure, its effect on pathway interactions, and the ultimate phenotypic outcome. Results BIOMNIGEM was able to generate coherent, mechanistically plausible explanations, demonstrating true reasoning capabilities beyond simple pattern matching.

Safety and Security Award Synthetic biology will need to be used safely and securely if local people are to solve local problems all around the world. The Safety and Security Committee is challenging teams to apply biological engineering approaches to manage risks associated with synthetic biology. Can you take the next step in progress towards knowledge, understanding, and tools that will make the use of synthetic biology safer and more secure? Visit the Special Prizes page for more information. Safety and Security Overview Building a powerful AI tool for biology comes with a great responsibility. We have integrated safety and security considerations into every step of our project design and deployment. Project Safety and Responsible AI Data Privacy and Ethics All data used to train BIOMNIGEM was sourced from public, anonymized databases (e.g., the Protein Data Bank, Human Cell Atlas). We did not use any personally identifiable or sensitive patient information, ensuring our project adheres to the highest ethical standards. Mitigating Bias Biological datasets can contain inherent biases. We actively worked to curate a balanced training corpus and are continuously developing methods to audit our model for potential biases (e.g., over-representation of certain gene families) to ensure its predictions are fair and reliable. Preventing Misuse While BIOMNIGEM is a tool for accelerating discovery, we recognize the dual-use potential of any powerful technology. Our model is designed as an assistant, not an autonomous agent. Its outputs are intended to be interpreted and validated by a human expert. The \"Biological Chain-of-Thought\" feature is a key part of this, as it makes the model's reasoning transparent and easier to scrutinize. Security and Open Source Licensing Platform Security Our web platform and APIs are built with modern security practices to protect against unauthorized access and ensure data integrity for our users. HTTPS encryption for all communications Input validation and sanitization Rate limiting to prevent abuse Secure authentication mechanisms Open Source with Confidence We believe the best way to ensure safety and promote beneficial use is through transparency. BIOMNIGEM is released under the Apache 2.0 License. This is a permissive open-source license that allows anyone to freely use, modify, and distribute the software for any purpose, including commercial use.
