    <h2>Science is a Team Sport</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>We strongly believe that collaboration is the key to scientific progress. Throughout our project, we actively sought out opportunities to learn from, and contribute to, the work of other teams.</p>

        <p class="card-text">The [Example Team Name] from [University Name] was working on engineering a novel enzyme but was struggling to analyze their mutagenesis screening data. We collaborated with them by using an early version of BIOMNIGEM to process their protein sequence and activity data.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-success">
          <strong>Impact:</strong> Our model helped them identify two promising mutation hotspots that they had previously overlooked, providing them with a clear direction for their next round of experiments.

        <p class="card-text">During the [Country/Region] iGEM Meetup, several teams expressed interest in our method for converting gene expression data into "cell sentences" for LLM analysis. We formalized our Python scripts into a well-documented package and shared it openly on GitHub.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
          <strong>Community Impact:</strong> Team [Another Team Name] later used our pipeline to analyze their transcriptomics data, saving them weeks of development time.

          <strong>Learning Exchange:</strong> We shared our experiences with model fine-tuning and, in turn, learned about different approaches to data acquisition and hardware optimization from other teams. This collaborative brainstorming helped everyone involved refine their project strategies.
